     <h3>READY TO GET STARTED?</h3>
    <p>Turkey offers the ideal conditions for a successful hair transplant. As such, it has been many years since the country has become a destination of choice for hair implants.</p>
    <p>But how is it possible to offer services at such competitive prices ? First of all, the cosmetic surgery industry is heavily subsidized by the Turkish state. Secondly the lower cost of living allows our hair implant to be more affordable than in Europe. Those are the reasons why we can offer very advantageous prices without denying the quality of our transplants.</p>

            <div class="content" style="display: block;">
            <p>A hair transplant is a surgical procedure in which hair is moved from the back and/or sides of the scalp, where it is permanent (donor area), to areas that are thinning or bald on the front, top, or crown of the scalp (recipient area). Once transplanted, the hair will continue to grow for a person’s lifetime. At Bernstein Medical we perform the two most effective types of hair restoration procedures, Follicular Unit Transplantation (DHI) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). For the latter, we use new robotic technology.</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="set">
            <a href="javascript:;"><span>Q2</span> What is Follicular Unit Transplantation (DHI)?</a>
            <div class="content">
            <p>Follicular Unit Transplantation (DHI) is a hair restoration procedure in which naturally-occurring groups of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are transplanted from the donor area to the recipient area.</p>
            <p>In DHI, after the patient’s scalp is numbed, the doctor removes a thin strip of tissue from the back and/or sides of the scalp. The donor strip is then separated into hundreds to thousands of individual follicular units using precise stereo-microscopic dissection techniques. As the follicular unit grafts are being prepared, the doctor makes tiny slits in the scalp (recipient sites), into which the grafts are placed.</p>
            <p>If well executed, the use of follicular units ensures that the transplant results will look completely natural and be undetectable. Follicular Unit Transplantation was conceived by Dr. Bernstein and first described in the medical literature in his landmark 1995 publication.</p>

            <div class="set">
            <a href="javascript:;"><span>Q3</span> What is Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)?</a>
            <div class="content">
            <p>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) is a method of extracting, or “harvesting,” follicular units one-by-one directly from the scalp. In FUE, an instrument is used to make small, circular incisions in the skin around follicular units, separating them from the surrounding tissue. The follicular unit is then extracted (pulled) directly from the scalp, leaving a small open hole that heals with a small white mark.</p>
            <p>This method of donor harvesting is what differentiates the FUE procedure from Follicular Unit Transplantation (DHI), in which the donor hair is removed in a long strip that is dissected into individual follicular units under a stereo-microscope. The creation of recipient sites and the placing of follicular unit grafts are essentially the same in FUE and DHI procedures.</p>
            <p>The FUE technique was conceived by Dr. Ray Woods in the 1990s in Australia and was introduced into the medical literature by Rassman and Bernstein in 2002. In 2011, Dr. Bernstein began performing FUE using robotic technology, and now all FUE hair transplants at Bernstein Medical use the speed, precision, and consistency of the robotic hair transplant system.</p>

            <a href="javascript:;"><span>Q4</span> Am I a Candidate for a Hair Restoration Procedure?</a>
            <div class="content">
            <p>The best way to find out is to be evaluated by a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon specializing in hair restoration. The answer will depend on the cause of your hair loss, your age, the stability of your donor supply, how extensive your hair loss is, your expectations and a number of other important factors that will be taken into account.

            <a href="javascript:;"><span>Q5</span> Should I Choose DHI or FUE?</a>
            <div class="content">
            <p>In general, DHI yields the most donor hair. Therefore, the procedure is best suited for more extensive hair loss and in patients where the main concern is the maximum use of one’s donor supply. The hair is maximized because of the precise nature of stereo-microscopic dissection and the fact that all the hair is harvested from the mid-portion of the permanent zone where the hair is most dense and stable. A limitation of DHI is that it leaves a line scar in the donor area. With normal styling, this is easily covered with hair, but it precludes someone from wearing their hair very short.</p>

            <p>FUE is more appropriate for patients who would like to keep their hair very short or who can’t limit strenuous activities in the post-op period. In general, younger patients who need to keep their styling options flexible choose FUE, whereas those who desire the most coverage opt for DHI. Read a detailed comparison of DHI and FUE on our FUE Pros & Cons page.</p>

I never felt pressured to go through with the procedure, and they took the time to explain every detail to me.

<p>On the 90th day after the hair transplant, the hair began to grow again after the shedding period, and the hair that had not fallen off before also grew quite long. The hair on the back of my head was also long, and there was no indication that the hair follicles had been taken out.</p>

<p>I was suffering from male bald pattern hair loss. It was affecting me, I knew I had to do something to regain my confidence again. I am glad to have engaged Dr. Emily and her team for my hair transplant. I am satisfied with the results and it was a great experience. Dr. Emily is a sincere, approachable and very meticulous in her work. I was impressed by the realism with which the clinic approached the job - they did not over-promise and they were clear about what they could and couldn't do. The procedure itself was carried out professionally and efficiently. I would highly recommend Dr. Emily.</p>
